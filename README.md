# Q-Learning: A Brief Overview

## Introduction
Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that identifies the value of actions in different states. This README provides an overview of Q-Learning, focusing on its application in a simulated environment.

## Key Components
- **State:** Current position of the agent in the environment.
- **Action:** Step taken based on the state.
- **Reward:** Feedback received for an action.

## Environment and Agents
The example environment is a guitar building factory with nine locations. Robots in this environment act as agents.

## Learning Process
Q-Learning involves learning the best actions in each state based on rewards. The algorithm uses a learning rate (alpha) and a discount factor (gamma) to update the Q-Table and identify optimal paths.

## Practical Application
The implementation demonstrates how Q-Learning can optimize routes within a simulated environment.

## Conclusion
Q-Learning is effective for decision-making tasks in various scenarios. It's based on the concept of maximizing rewards through learned experiences.
